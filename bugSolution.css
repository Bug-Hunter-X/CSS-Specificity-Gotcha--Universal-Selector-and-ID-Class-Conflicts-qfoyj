To solve the specificity issue and ensure the expected color assignments, several approaches are possible:

**Approach 1: Restructuring Selectors**

This approach focuses on writing selectors in a way that avoids specificity conflicts.  By being more precise in targeting elements, the need for resolving complex specificity rules is eliminated. 

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-div {
  color: red;
}

#specific-div {
  color: green;
}

#specific-div.special-div {
  color: orange;
}
```

**Approach 2: Using `!important` (Generally Discouraged)**

While functional, this approach is generally discouraged due to its potential for creating maintenance issues and making the CSS less predictable.

```css
/* bugSolution.css (using !important - less preferred) */
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-div {
  color: red !important;
}

#specific-div {
  color: green !important;
}

#specific-div.special-div {
  color: orange !important;
}
```

The choice between these approaches depends on the overall structure and complexity of your CSS.  Approach 1 is generally preferred for its cleaner and more maintainable approach.
