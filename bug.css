The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-div {
  color: red;
}

#specific-div {
  color: green;
}

div.special-div {
  color: purple;
}

#specific-div.special-div {
  color: orange;
}
```

The issue stems from the unexpected interaction of class and ID selectors with a universal selector (`div`).  The specificity rules might not behave as intuitively expected.
